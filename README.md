Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build the site locally.

Modify `index.md` for the homepage.

TODOs:
- Remote theme vs theme?
- Edit `header.html` to suit needs. Maybe add image. Note how it relates to `_config.yml`.
- Edit the files in `_includes`
- Figure out how socials work and get rid of them or add LinkedIn.
